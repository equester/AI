She is trapped in her life and has abanboned all hopes of life getting any better.Her pimp sends her to a new client and she mets Theroen, a powerful vampire who starts to change her.Due to the drugs in her system, Two does not become a vampire right away and remains a few months with Theroen before the final change. During that time, she discovers how intricate and dangerous the politics of vampire life are.This is not your typical vampire story. I  kept being pleasantly surprised by new concepts. The plot is well spaced and kept me interested until the end and, as other readers, i am willing to read the sequel.I gave it four stars instead of five because I kept wishing that the author explain, and better showcase, the love and connection between Theroen and Two. We get a very simple and quick explanation of why Theroen chose Two but it didn't feel real, logical or emotional to me. Also, the vampire scene, lifestyle and politics is touched upon but not developed. Hopefully  next time...\n","\n","From a sad story to a sad ending I'm more angry the rest of the books aren't free yet. I'm an avid vampire lover & this book kept me turning each page. Some short story authors & editors should take tips from such books as this.\n","\n","Plain and simple, I picked this up as a freebie because it was a vampire book.  All I can say is it is unassuming AND not the same predictible story! I love reading the tried and true series, but it is so nice to find a new author (well, new to me) with 'out of the norm' characters and a fresh storyline.  I'm not going into the storyline because you can read it on the cover, but when you find yourself thinking about the characters three days after you finish the book - you know it made an impression on you.  This was a really good book! Sure, there were a few narratives I hurried through, but overall the author did a great job of sucking me in (no pun intended) and wondering what would come next.  I finished in one day and ran straight to the computer to search the author for more.  I don't see one, but I hope there's a sequel coming soon!!\n","\n","i saw this book listed for free on kindle, so i figured what the heck? if i dont like it no big deal. but once again im glad my frugalness paid off. i couldnt put it down. i was sucked in from the very begining. starting with Two's sad lifestyle, then through the heart breaking and soul shattering events with Thereon. i admit that i might have had a few tears that were able to escape run down my cheeks. its a very good read, especially if you get it while its free. but even if you dont its worth the few bucks to pick it up. also according to the thank you at the end from the author there will be a sequel! cant

The limit is in number of characters, so you can check whether your inputs are too long by checking
