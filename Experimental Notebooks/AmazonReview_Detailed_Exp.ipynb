And the ones way before that were Android, all Motorola. So this is my first Apple phone. Because 3/4 of my family are Apple people...we won't go into why but I blame it on the schools...they use FaceTime a lot. So, hence, if I want to be part of the social circle I have to use Apple. As for the phone, it's an okay phone. I like Live Tiles better than static apps. I like the power of Windows 10 Mobile. Siri has nothing on Cortana. Microsoft phones are durable and work as well as any with Apple's reputation. So I usually only use the iPhone on WiFi. But this certified refurbished phone works and works consistently. My one big complaint is it uses a Micro SIM instead of a Nano SIM. I can't swap SIMs to use cellular service on my main number. I bought this one for the extraordinary price. But I see another, Nano SIM model, certified refurbished iPhone in my future. Unless, of course, Apple decides to share FaceTime and iTunes with other platforms like Microsoft shares Office, Skype, Wunderlist, and many other apps with it's competitors.

I have been wanting a iphone for awhile but i don't have 600 to shell out for one.

So my best guess it is unlocked and previous owner used them. either way it worked just fine with Straight Talk i could text and send photos. I have a sim card slot but did not have to use it they ask me for some numbers and it worked.

I\\'m very happy :)\\nOrdered the phone and waited a week for it to get to my home and not even cut on ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ NEVER again save your money\\nhad phone for 4 months so far...everything is still working good\\nPerfect!\\nI shure did order for iPhone 6\\nPerfect!\\nno quality\\nbattery doesn\\'t last and the phone randomly restarts. Definitely will be getting my money back.\\napple iphone 5S 16gb WORKING 2 HOURS\\nVery good although it took two more days than planed to get it because of the season.\\nIt works great. It hasn\\'t overheated or the battery isn\\'t damaged like the other reviews said. I was scared to buy it at first because of the reviews but it hasn\\'t had any problems.\\nThe phone was certified reburbished but was defective, battery heats up tremendously, very slow, fingerprint login did not work, the cable that came for charging the phone was also defective, it had a slight annoying sound when charging, like a buzz. Unfortunately I bought the phone while on vacations in the US and did not try it until I was back in my country until some weeks later when I could not return it. I sent an email to the seller telling them about the problem, as I had to be in the US for some days to see if I could return it or exchange it, but the \"return window\" was closed, and even though I explained the situation, that I was not in the country to send it back, etc. they did not care. Do yourself a favor and do not buy refurbished phones, at least not from this seller.\\nworks as expected, for my daughter he is not complaining\\nWorks like a charm. As good as new.\\nI was very happy to find this iPhone 5S for such a good price, since it had been certified refurbished. I bought it a few months ago and it worked wonderfully. However I started noticing issues with the sound after about two months. I could only use the speaker function to dial and to receive calls. If I used earbuds, it seemed to work better. However, yesterday when I put my earbuds in to listen to music, no sound came out at all. When I tried to answer a phone cal, I put it on speaker and could barely understand anything my friend was saying. She couldn\\'t understand me either.I\\'m pretty disappointed with the quality of this phone and wish that these issues had occurred within a month so I could return this phone and get my money back. Unfortunately it\\'s too late now and I\\'m stuck with a phone that can\\'t call or receive calls and can\\'t even act as an iPod for music. Pretty disappointing indeed.\\nI ordered this phone and when I received it it won\\'t charge up or cut on.\\nGot it from Techarvard. Broken charging cable and charging port of phone. Returned it.\\nThis phone states it is AT&T compatible and unlocked but AT&T could not activate the phone, said that Verizon would have to unlock it.I purchased 8 for a business and probably will have to return them all. Called the seller and they gave me a song and dance abouthow I could unlock the phone. If it is advertised unlocked, it should be unlocked.\\nWorks great. Exactly what I needed!\\n'"
